Clicking on the "Plus" button brings up the add option sheet. On the sheet there is a quote and a textfield where the user can enter an option. Clicking the "Add" button doesn't dismiss the sheet but clears the text field and lets the user enter another option. Once all options, the user wants, have been entered then clicking on the "Done" button closes the sheet.
